# Exercise 5: Inventory
# 1. Suppose that our store has a total of 100 items in the inventory. 
# Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of 
# ordered items to be taken out from the inventory and checks if 
# there are enough items. If not, print “There aren’t enough 
# items.”. Otherwise, the program further checks if the 
# inventory will be less than 50%. If so, urge the user with the 
# number of items to fill up the inventory. For example, if there 
# are 48 items left, then print “Please fill inventory with 52 
# more items.” If not, print “No need to fill inventory at 
# time being.” Finally, report the number of remaining items.

# 1) Re-do Example 5 by using a different approach (not nested if)
